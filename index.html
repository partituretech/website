    <h1 class="title">We are on a mission<br>to transcribe all music <em><br>ever</em> recorded üéº</h1>
    <h2 class="pitch-title">The ecosystem for sheet music is stuck in the 19th century</h2>
    <div class="pitch-p">Over the years we have become frustrated with the state of the sheet music ecosystem. Our guitar teachers had to transcribe the songs we wanted to learn themselves before we could start the actual lesson. Scores that we sought when practicing did not exist, were incomplete, missing the most crucial instruments and solos, or were outright incorrect. Some of the complete scores were paper scans stuck in PDF formats, depriving us of the possibility to play back the score and slow it down on the computer like we have gotten used to with Guitar Pro. Letting computers digitize these scores turned out to be <em>surprisingly difficult</em>. The available digital scores we did rely on disappeared because of website server failures, or because they were taken down. Even official store-bought sheet music was often not true to how the artist would play it. <br><br>When composing our own songs and in need for inspiration, there was no way to query existing scores for sections in a particular key, chord progression or any other contextual element. Then, when our bands pooled money together to get transcriptions produced to play covers, no open markets existed at all that allowed spreading the cost of transcribing over a large (unknown) group of people. <strong>A perfect transcription costs ‚Ç¨900 for an <em>average</em> song</strong>. That&#x27;s too much for individual musicians to afford on a continuous basis. Transcribing music is hard for humans, and <em>even harder for computers</em>. No wonder that qualitative scores are so hard to come by!<strong></strong><br></div>
    <h2 class="pitch-title">What we need...</h2>
    <div class="pitch-p">We&#x27;ve had enough of this. The situation is not improving. After more than <em>13 years</em> of this suffering we have come to this conclusion:<strong></strong></div>
    <div class="div-block-3">
      <div class="text-block">üí°</div>
      <div class="pitch-p proposal">What we need is a <strong>public internet-wide permanent digital archive</strong> <strong>of source code to <em>all</em> recorded music</strong> that can <strong>stand the test of time</strong> and is <strong>intended to be <em>complete</em></strong>. A planet-owned system that incentivizes every musician on Earth to make the collection <em>perfect</em> and <em>available</em>. An <em>immutable</em> Wikipedia-meets-Github for the source code of music. </div>
    </div>
    <div class="pitch-p">But it cannot exist yet. More than 91+ million songs exist in recordings. Yet <strong>only 0.1% of all music has ever been transcribed into its source code. Only a fraction of the sheet music is digital. And only a fraction of <em>that </em>is machine-readable</strong>. More importantly, <strong>no economic incentive system exists to fix this</strong>. At ‚Ç¨900 per song, this is an <strong>‚Ç¨81+ billion opportunity, totally overlooked by technologists.</strong></div>
    <h2 class="pitch-title">Imagine the possibilities...</h2>
    <div class="pitch-p">Imagine what can be done with the <em>complete dataset</em> of digital scores from <em>all music ever recorded</em>. We could:<strong></strong></div>

    <h2 class="pitch-title">Our goals</h2>
    <div class="pitch-p">We are visionary chief technologists building <strong>an infrastructure layer that can be used by all existing score-editing software and transcription service companies</strong>. <strong>A protocol</strong> to <strong>incentivize every musician and music education institution on the planet</strong> to <em>blitzscale</em> the work of <strong>transcribing the complete collection of Earth music</strong>, including your niche artist that no one made guitar tabs for, <strong>as quickly as possible</strong>, and having <em>fun</em> while doing it. This requires building 3 open-source products:</div>
    <div class="products-container">
      <ul class="products w-list-unstyled">
        <li class="product">
          <div class="product-inner">
            <div class="icon-fa collab">ÔìÑ</div>
            <h3>Web collaboration</h3>
            <p class="product-desc">A real-time free collaborative digital score editor, community builder and project management system. Supports standard notation, guitar tabs, percussion, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klavarskribo" target="_blank" class="pitch-a">Klavarskribo</a>, <a href="http://musicnotation.org/" target="_blank" class="pitch-a">Chromatic Staff</a>, <a href="https://www.hummingbirdnotation.com/" target="_blank" class="pitch-a">Hummingbird</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodeka_music_notation" target="_blank" class="pitch-a">Dodeka</a> and PDF printing. A foundational layer that can be used by Noteflight, Flat.io, Sibelius, Jellynote, Soundslice and UltimateGuitar.com to build on.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li class="product">
          <div class="product-inner">
            <div class="icon-fa incentive">Ôîû</div>
            <h3>Incentive layer</h3>
            <p class="product-desc">An incentive protocol that aligns interest for our goal <em>better and more profitable than the current publisher-oriented system does</em>. A global reputation system for transcription and validation that economically rewards musicians for using their ears with claims on future platform fee revenue, relative to their contribution.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li class="product">
          <div class="product-inner">
            <div class="icon-fa storage">ÔïÇ</div>
            <h3>Permanent immutable storage</h3>
            <p class="product-desc">An immutable decentralized public permissionless blockchain that maintains the total content-addressable score graph &amp; recording metadata, tracks all revisions, manages the incentive layer and is resistant against calamities, political unrest and regulatory madness.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="what-can-we-do">
      <h2 class="pitch-title">What can we do with it?</h2>
      <div class="pitch-p">The system we build revolves around a metadata index of all recordings known to mankind. Participants build reputation in communities around artists and genres. They are incentivized to administer, track and mark which scores, parts and solos are still incorrect or missing. This way, you can tell how far the collection for an artist is on its way to completion. Having this collaborative score editor and project management system doesn&#x27;t constrain you to only work on scores for recognized records. You are free to compose your own songs, create new compositions with others, or base new work off of parts from other songs. Due to its branching version control system, attribution is perfect and you can always tell where any inspiration came from.</div>
    </div>
    <h2 class="pitch-title">How does it work?</h2>
    <div class="pitch-p">When contributors transcribe songs, they are awarded proportional<em> shares </em>when their contributions get accepted by the community and linked as part of a main transcript for a given recording. A part of the blockchain <a href="https://www.binance.vision/glossary/block-reward" target="_blank" class="pitch-a">Block Rewards</a> and query fees are paid out to shareholders when scores they contributed to are used in computations for the application platform. The fee reward system is effectively a collectivized lottery based on transcription submissions. Additionally, awarded shares may be sold, giving them a floating value to speculate on.</div>
    <h2 class="pitch-title">Imagine the fun we would have</h2>
    <div class="pitch-p">Imagine we have launched. Suddenly, you can get rewarded for transcribing your favorite artist. Even for the severely unpopular songs you love! Gone are the days of sharing sheet music online and it being forgotten, or worse, <em>you</em> and your skills being forgotten. If you are an established artist earning nothing on the sale of your (non-existent?) sheet music through publishers, you are at an advantage being able to import your own work quickly. Organize yourself in communities around genres and artists to find friends-to-be that feel the same commitment and love for scores you like. You may find yourself being a reputable member that is asked to review scores with your expertise and sharp ears. If you are more financial-minded you can keep track of the <em>share prices</em> for different artists and songs. You may see an interesting opportunity and want to fund the creation of specific transcriptions for their associated<em> shares, </em>or get your friends to do the work and sell you the shares. What a goldrush!</div>
    <h2 class="pitch-title">Let&#x27;s compose history together</h2>
    <div class="pitch-p">To make our dream possible, we are welcoming a lot of new friends, and need a lot of helping hands. Are you excited? Please get in touch if you are:</div>
