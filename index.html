    <div class="intro-container">
      <h2 class="pitch-title">The ecosystem for sheet music is stuck in the 19th century</h2>
      <div class="pitch-p">Over the years we have become frustrated with the state of the sheet music ecosystem. Our guitar teachers had to transcribe the songs we wanted to learn themselves before we could start the actual lesson. Scores that we sought when practicing did not exist, were incomplete, missing the most crucial instruments and solos, or were outright incorrect. Some of the complete scores were paper scans stuck in PDF formats, depriving us of the possibility to play back the score and slow it down on the computer like we have gotten used to with Guitar Pro. Letting computers digitize these scores turned out to be <em>surprisingly difficult</em>. The available digital scores we did rely on disappeared because of website server failures, or because they were taken down. Even official store-bought sheet music was often not true to how the artist would play it. <br><br>When composing our own songs and in need for inspiration, there was no way to query existing scores for sections in a particular key, chord progression or any other contextual element. Then, when our bands pooled money together to get transcriptions produced to play covers, no open markets existed at all that allowed spreading the cost of transcribing over a large (unknown) group of people. <strong>A perfect transcription costs €900 for an <em>average</em> song</strong>. That&#x27;s too much for individual musicians to afford on a continuous basis. Transcribing music is hard for humans, and <em>even harder for computers</em>. No wonder that qualitative scores are so hard to come by!<strong></strong><br></div>
    </div>
    <div class="need-container">
      <h2 class="pitch-title">What we need...</h2>
      <div class="pitch-p">We&#x27;ve had enough of this. The situation is not improving. After more than <em>13 years</em> of suffering we have come to this conclusion:<strong></strong></div>
      <div class="idea-container">
        <div class="bubl-icon">💡</div>
        <div class="pitch-p proposal">What we need is a <strong>public internet-wide permanent digital archive</strong> <strong>of source code to <em>all</em> recorded music</strong> that can <strong>stand the test of time</strong> and is <strong>intended to be <em>complete</em></strong>. A planet-owned system that incentivizes every musician on Earth to make the collection <em>perfect</em> and <em>freely available</em>. An <em>immutable</em> Wikipedia-meets-Github for the source code of music. </div>
      </div>
      <div class="pitch-p">But it cannot exist yet. More than 91+ million songs exist in recordings. Yet <strong>only 0.1% of all music has ever been transcribed into its source code. Only a fraction of the sheet music is digital. And only a fraction of <em>that </em>is machine-readable</strong>. More importantly, <strong>no economic incentive system exists to fix this</strong>. At €900 per song, this is an <strong>€81+ billion opportunity, totally overlooked by technologists.</strong></div>
    </div>
    <div class="usecase-container">
      <h2 class="pitch-title">Imagine the possibilities...</h2>

      <h2 class="pitch-title">Our goals</h2>
      <div class="pitch-p">We are visionary chief technologists building <strong>an infrastructure layer that can be used by all existing score-editing software and transcription service companies</strong>. <strong>A protocol</strong> to <strong>incentivize every musician and music education institution on the planet</strong> to <em>blitzscale</em> the work of <strong>transcribing the complete collection of Earth music</strong>, including your niche artist that no one made guitar tabs for, <strong>as quickly as possible</strong>, and having <em>fun</em> while doing it. This requires building 3 open-source products:</div>

                <div class="icon-fa collab"></div>
                <h3 class="heading-2">Web collaboration</h3>
                <p class="product-desc">A real-time free collaborative digital score editor, community builder and project management system. Supports standard notation, guitar tabs, percussion, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klavarskribo" target="_blank" class="pitch-a">Klavarskribo</a>, <a href="http://musicnotation.org/" target="_blank" class="pitch-a">Chromatic Staff</a>, <a href="https://www.hummingbirdnotation.com/" target="_blank" class="pitch-a">Hummingbird</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodeka_music_notation" target="_blank" class="pitch-a">Dodeka</a> and PDF printing.

                <h3 class="heading-3">Incentive layer</h3>
                <p class="product-desc">An incentive protocol that aligns interest for our goal <em>better and more profitable than the current publisher-oriented system does</em>.

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="what-can-we-do">
      <h2 class="pitch-title">What can we do with it?</h2>
      <div class="pitch-p">The system we build revolves around a metadata index of all recordings known to mankind. Participants build reputation in communities around artists and genres. They are incentivized to administer, track and mark which scores, parts and solos are still incorrect or missing. This way, you can tell how far the collection for an artist is on its way to completion. Having this collaborative score editor and project management system doesn&#x27;t constrain you to only work on scores for recognized records. You are free to compose your own songs, create new compositions with others, or base new work off of parts from other songs. Due to its branching version control system, attribution is perfect and you can always tell where any inspiration came from.</div>
    </div>
    <h2 class="pitch-title">What&#x27;s in it for me?</h2>
    <div class="pitch-p">Like a library, access to scores is <strong>free and for public use</strong>. Use of the complete dataset for calculations, research or app development is available for a fee, which subsidizes the free use.</div>
    <div class="audience-container">
      <div class="centerer">

              <h3 class="audience-header">for Developers, Academics, AI Researchers, Copyright lawyers, Historians, Music Education Institutes</h3>
              <p class="product-desc"><strong>Query the complete dataset </strong>and all its interrelations using<strong> custom logic</strong> for a usage-based fee. </p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="audience">
            <div class="audience-inner _3">
              <div class="icon-fa collab"></div>
              <h3 class="heading-7">for Rights Holders</h3>
              <p class="product-desc">Earn more with your sheet music than you ever could by selling song books. </p>
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2 class="pitch-title">How does it work?</h2>
    <div class="pitch-p">The platform works by bringing the <em>future value</em> of the complete dataset to the present using a financial instrument (like a bank). When contributors transcribe songs or missing parts, they are awarded<em> Shares </em>in those songs proportional to the size of the work. When the transcript is used in a search result, the contributor gets paid. It is effectively a collectivized lottery based on transcription submissions. Shares may be traded, giving them a floating value to speculate on. This increases the value of transcriptions beyond their current market value.</div>
    <h2 class="pitch-title">Imagine the fun we would have</h2>
    <div class="pitch-p">Imagine we have launched. Suddenly, you can get rewarded for transcribing your favorite artist. Even for the severely unpopular songs you love! Gone are the days of sharing sheet music online and it being forgotten, or worse, <em>you</em> and your skills being forgotten. If you are an established artist earning nothing on the sale of your (non-existent?) sheet music through publishers, you are at an advantage being able to import your own work quickly. Organize yourself in communities around genres and artists to find friends-to-be that feel the same commitment and love for scores you like. You may find yourself being a reputable member that is asked to review scores with your expertise and sharp ears. If you are more financial-minded you can keep track of the <em>share prices</em> for different artists and songs. You may see an interesting opportunity and want to fund the creation of specific transcriptions for their associated<em> shares, </em>or get your friends to do the work and sell you the shares. What a goldrush!</div>
